# Gasazon - Onum technical test

Gasazon is a web application designed to simplify the process of buying petrol in the year 2050, where resources are scarce. The app allows users to calculate the amount of petrol liters they need to buy and find the best prices from various petrol stations. Prices are updated dynamically every 30 seconds.

## Features

- **Calculate Petrol Liters:** Enter the desired amount of petrol liters and get the optimal number of bottles to purchase.
- **Real-Time Price Updates:** Prices from petrol stations are fetched and updated every 30 seconds.
- **Station Comparison:** View and compare prices from up to 10 different petrol stations.
- **Responsive Design:** Designed to work seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests are included to ensure the functionality and reliability of the application.


## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** React framework for server-rendered React applications.
- **React.js:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Typed superset of JavaScript for improved developer productivity.
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.
- **API Integration:** Fetches petrol station data using RESTful APIs in Next.js.
- **Jest:** JavaScript testing framework for unit testing and code coverage analysis.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
